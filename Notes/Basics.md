# Variables

* Variable types: `let`, `const`, `var`
  * var must not be used as var does not works with scope
  * const is used to declare `CONSTANT` values. That we do not want to change
  * let can be re-assigned
* JavaScript is a dynamic type language and we do not need to define variable types in it.


# Data Types
* How data is saved in memory and how it is accessed, on the basis of this data is categorized. `Primitive Types` and `Non Primitive Types`
  * Primitive: CALL BY VALUE
  * Non Primitive: CALL BY REFERENCE
 * Primitive Types: String, Number, Boolean, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt
 *    NOTE: They all holds single value at a time
 * Non Primitive / Reference Types: Array, Objects, Functions
 * Stack Memory: Used By Primitive Types. It if accessed/assigned by copy
 * Heap Memory: Used by Non Primitive Types. It is accessed/assigned by reference
