# Basics

* Javascript executes `synchronously`. Code executes in sequence (form top to bottom)
  * Does not wait for any code or task that takes some time
  * Next operation (line of code) executes, when previous one is completed . 
* Default engine of javascript is `synchronous` but the complete runtime environment of javascript if `asynchronous`, hence  we can use async codes in JS
* Some built-in JS async tasks are:- setTimeout(), setInterval()

# Sync Code
* Also known as non-blocking code

# Async Code
* AKA blocking code
